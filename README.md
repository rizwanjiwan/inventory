# inventory
For students of my intro to programming class. This is a project we'll cowrite together during a class. It brings together all the basic principles. Note: this code is in no way meant to be deployed for production--it's a teaching tool. e.g. I've straight up included the DB password in this repo which is horrible for security. 

Once you fully understand this code and are comfortable extending and modifying it, you're ready to go to the next stage which is modern web development where we'll cover:
- Libraries (Composer)
- MVC (model view controller pattern)
- Templates (Blade)
- ORM (TBD)
- Web APIs with JSON
- Javascript+Vue.js (this gets really deep so we'll only go through the basics probably)

I'm debating teaching this in laravel or not... We'll see.
